> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
> 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
> 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
> 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
